![Battleship Game](Image/Demo.png)

- This is a command line interface game as of now, I am working on a graphical version.

<br>

# Command to run the game:

```
java battletest
```

<br>

# Rules ::

- You have three chances to hit the VULCAN ship before the VULCANS figure out your position and you fail to save the humanity.
- Enter the desired coordinates, make sure you enter the coordinates wisely as you will only get 3 chances.
- Coordinates Range (0-5)(0-5).
- You have to press enter after entering the value of x and the same goes for entering the value of y (Here x and y are the coordinates).
